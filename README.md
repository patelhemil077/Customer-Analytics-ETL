# Advanced Customer Analytics ETL Pipeline

## Project Overview

**Goal:**  
As a master’s student aspiring to enter the data engineering field, this project demonstrates my ability to design and implement an advanced ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline. The goal is to showcase my skills in cloud integration, data transformation, database management, and pipeline automation. Through this project, I aim to create a professional-grade portfolio piece that highlights my technical expertise across the full ETL lifecycle.

## Summary

This project focuses on building a scalable ETL pipeline for processing and analyzing customer purchasing data. It will involve extracting data from cloud storage, applying multiple transformations to enhance data quality, and loading it into a cloud data warehouse for analytics and reporting. Automation with Apache Airflow will ensure regular updates, and insights will be visualized in a BI tool like Power BI or Tableau, providing actionable reporting for business insights.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this project is to demonstrate practical ETL and data engineering skills essential for a career in data engineering or analytics. Specifically, this includes:

- Proficiency in cloud-based ETL workflows.
- Hands-on experience with automation tools (Apache Airflow) and cloud data warehouses (Google BigQuery, AWS Redshift, etc.).
- Ability to derive insights from raw data and present it in an accessible, business-friendly format.

This project serves as a comprehensive example of a robust ETL pipeline, showcasing my technical and analytical competencies to potential employers.

## Objectives

1. **Data Extraction**:
   - Automate the ingestion of large datasets from cloud storage (AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage).
   - Integrate multiple data sources into a single pipeline for consistent processing.

2. **Data Transformation**:
   - Clean and standardize raw data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and normalizing formats.
   - Perform data enrichment and create derived features for additional insights (e.g., customer lifetime value).
   - Aggregate data at various levels (e.g., monthly revenue) to support analysis.

3. **Data Loading**:
   - Design and implement a cloud-based data warehouse schema (star schema) for structured storage.
   - Develop an error-tolerant data loading process with logging for monitoring and auditing.

4. **Automation and Scheduling**:
   - Use Apache Airflow to automate ETL tasks with dependencies for scheduled or on-demand execution.
   - Configure logging, error handling, and notifications to ensure robust management of the pipeline.

5. **Data Analysis and Reporting**:
   - Write SQL queries to analyze purchasing trends, customer behavior, and other key performance indicators.
   - Visualize results in a BI tool (Power BI or Tableau) to create interactive dashboards showing trends, customer segments, and insights.

## Expected Outcomes

By the end of this project, I expect to achieve the following:

1. **Automated ETL Pipeline**:
   - A fully automated ETL pipeline that ingests, transforms, and loads data on a scheduled basis using Apache Airflow.
   - Clear, version-controlled scripts and configurations documented in GitHub.

2. **Cleaned and Enriched Data**:
   - A well-structured data warehouse containing clean, high-quality data ready for analysis.
   - Transformation scripts demonstrating best practices in data cleaning and enrichment.

3. **Business Insights**:
   - Analytical queries and visualizations highlighting customer behavior, purchasing trends, and more.
   - Dashboards in Power BI or Tableau that display trends, customer segments, and actionable insights.

4. **Portfolio-Ready Documentation**:
   - A comprehensive README detailing the project objectives, data schema, ETL pipeline architecture, setup instructions, and explanations of each step.
   - Visual diagrams of the ETL process and data workflow, providing a polished, professional presentation.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Customer-Analytics-ETL.git
Navigate to the project directory:
  ```bash
  cd Customer-Analytics-ETL
  ```
Create and activate a virtual environment:
  ```bash
  python3 -m venv env
  source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
  ```
Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
Set up cloud storage and data warehouse credentials:
Create an .env file in the root directory of the project.
Add your cloud storage and database credentials as environment variables, for example:
```plaintext
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret
DB_CONNECTION_STRING=your_database_connection_string
```
Usage
Data Extraction:

Run extract_data.py to download data from cloud storage.
Example command:
bash
Copy code
python scripts/extract_data.py
Data Transformation:

Run transform_data.py for data cleaning, enrichment, and aggregation.
Example command:
bash
Copy code
python scripts/transform_data.py
Data Loading:

Run load_data.py to upload transformed data into the data warehouse.
Example command:
bash
Copy code
python scripts/load_data.py
Automation with Airflow:

Set up Airflow and add your ETL scripts as tasks in a DAG.
Start the Airflow scheduler and web server to monitor the pipeline:
bash
Copy code
airflow scheduler &
airflow webserver
Visualization (Optional):

Use Power BI or Tableau to connect to your cloud data warehouse and create dashboards.
Configure auto-refresh in the BI tool to pull the latest data from the warehouse.
